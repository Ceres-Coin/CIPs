## Abstract

Is it possible to design an invitation mechanism in Ceres to attract more people to participate in the Ceres project and expand the scale of algorithmic stablecoins

## Motivation

The scale of the algorithmic stablecoin determines the success or failure of the project. Therefore, how to increase the scale is a very core issue. The invitation mechanism may be an option. For example, users are encouraged to invite more people to participate in the Ceres project, provide collateral, trade, or liquidation arbitrage, and reward the inviter. So far, no algorithmic stablecoin project has done this. This is an innovation. But doing so may also bring some negative effects.
