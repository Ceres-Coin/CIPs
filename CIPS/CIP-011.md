## Abstract

Design a mechanism to provide stable income for holders of Ceres revenue tokens and encourage the holding of income tokens

## Motivation

Ceres' revenue tokens should not only benefit from liquidation collateral, but there should also be a mechanism that can provide holders with stable income. It is recommended to consider putting a certain proportion of collateral into aggregate beneficiaries to obtain stable income and distribute it to holders of income tokens. This mechanism will promote the holding of revenue tokens and the increase in prices, and the wealth effect brought about by this will attract more people to participate in Ceres and expand the scale of algorithmic stablecoins.
