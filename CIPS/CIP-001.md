| 001  | Design the transfer fee mechanism in Ceres transfer | WalterKohn | Draft  | Standards Track | ERC      | 2021-6-15 |



## Abstract

The mechanism is based on Ceres' transfers, and a 5% transfer fee is obtained. The 5% will be allocated as follows, 3% will return to the liquidity pool, 1% will be shared with Ceres holders, and 1% will be burned and destroyed.

## Motivation

We regard the design of transfer fee mechanism as a useful attempt. Because we believe that this mechanism may bring the following benefits.

Always maintain and expand Ceres' liquidity pool.

Increase a certain amount of burning to control the total amount of currency issuance.

Give rewards to holders to promote the stability of currency value.

The above three points will contribute to the stability and development of the Ceres stablecoin.
