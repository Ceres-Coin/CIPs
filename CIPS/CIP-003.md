## Abstract

For Ceres' transfer fee, it is recommended to design it as 5%. Among them, 2% belongs to the technology bonus pool, and 3% belongs to the super node bonus pool.

## Motivation

The main purpose of this proposal is to incentivize the developers and supernodes of the Ceres project.

This proposal will help attract more developers to join the Ceres project and enhance the continuous development and iteration of project technology. In addition, the incentives for supernodes will promote users to hold a certain amount of tokens to become super nodes, which is a beneficial token economics mechanism and also contributes to community governance based on supernodes.
