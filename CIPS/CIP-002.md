| 002  | Design distribution mechanism in Ceres transaction | WalterKohn | Draft  | Standards Track | ERC      | 2021-6-15 |



## Abstract

The mechanism is allocated based on the amount of funds in the Dex transaction and liquidity pool of the Ceres project.

For example, 5%-10% of the total transaction volume is allocated as follows:

When the amount of funds in the liquidity pool is greater than 10 million U.S. dollars, 2% will return to the liquidity pool, 1% will be burned, and 2% will go to the reserve fund.

When the amount of funds in the liquidity pool is greater than US$1 million and less than US$10 million, 4% will return to the liquidity pool, 2% will be burned, and 4% will go to the reserve fund.

The specific ratio can be adjusted according to the actual situation.

## Motivation

Based on the advantages and disadvantages of some typical algorithmic stablecoins that have come out, we believe that the size of the liquidity pool of algorithmic stablecoins is critical to the success of the project. The link increases the distribution mechanism to achieve this.
