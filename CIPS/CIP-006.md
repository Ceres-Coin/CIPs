| 006  | Ceres needs to design a reserve mechanism | WalterKohn,AndrewOlah | Draft  | Standards Track | ERC      | 2021-6-22 |



## Abstract

In order to improve the stability of Ceres, it is recommended to design a reserve fund system, which is equivalent to the foreign exchange reserves of sovereign countries.

## Motivation

A method similar to the united curve can be adopted to obtain a certain scale of reserves. The reserve fund mechanism will help stability. When the price of Ceres stablecoin fluctuates sharply, the stability of Ceres can be restored by operating the reserve fund. This has been proven to be an effective way of foreign exchange reserve management by sovereign countries.
