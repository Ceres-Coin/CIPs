## Abstract

In order to combat the potential death spiral problem of algorithmic stablecoins below the peg price, transaction penalties may be an option.

## Motivation

When the algorithmic stablecoin is lower than the peg price, it will often cause the holder to sell it, that is, continue to sell the algorithmic stablecoin, which causes the price to move further away from the peg price, resulting in a death spiral. The solution that can be considered is to impose a certain degree of price penalty on selling behavior when the price is lower than the peg price. This penalty can be 5% to slow down the selling and price decline.
