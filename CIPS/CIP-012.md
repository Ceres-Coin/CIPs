## Abstract

A rule-based lottery mechanism that regularly rewards Ceres holders

## Motivation

Part of Ceres' income is planned as a pool of funds and distributed to Ceres holders in the form of a lottery. The basic rule is that the more Ceres tokens held and the longer the time, the greater the possibility of receiving rewards. The purpose of this mechanism is to encourage the holding of Ceres tokens and increase the interest of the project.
