## Abstract

Ceres' stablecoin should be linked to a collateral, and the collateral ratio should be flexibly adjusted.

## Motivation

We believe that in order to ensure the stability of algorithmic stablecoins, the introduction of a mortgage mechanism is a good choice. Let Ceres be linked to a relatively stable collateral, such as USDC or ETH, which will greatly improve stability. At the same time, it is necessary to flexibly adjust the mortgage ratio, reduce the mortgage ratio when the value of Ceres's stablecoin is high, and increase the mortgage ratio when the value is low.
