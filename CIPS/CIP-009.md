## Abstract

When the algorithmic stablecoin is lower than the peg price, use the bond mechanism to stabilize the algorithmic stablecoin price

## Motivation

Bonds like Basis Cash are a valuable mechanism that allows users to buy Ceres at a discount when the price is lower than the peg price. This can lock in a certain amount of Ceres stablecoins, reduce selling pressure and enhance market confidence. After Ceres returns to above the peg price, users can redeem the bonds to obtain income.
